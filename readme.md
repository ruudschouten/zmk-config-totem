## HOW TO USE

- fork this repo
- `git clone` your repo, to create a local copy on your PC (you can use the [command line](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) or [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/))
- adjust the totem.keymap file (find all the keycodes on [the zmk docs pages](https://zmk.dev/docs/codes/))
- `git push` your repo to your fork
- on the GitHub page of your fork navigate to "Actions"
- scroll down and unzip the `firmware.zip` archive that contains the latest firmware
- connect the left half of the TOTEM to your PC, press reset twice
- the keyboard should now appear as a mass storage device
- drag'n'drop the `totem_left-seeeduino_xiao_ble-zmk.uf2` file from the archive onto the storage device
- repeat this process with the right half and the `totem_right-seeeduino_xiao_ble-zmk.uf2` file.
